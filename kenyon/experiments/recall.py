"""Pattern completion: teach the fly odour A, then give it only PART of A and see how much it recalls.

Tests the "the impulse replays" idea. In a real associative memory the question is whether an incomplete cue
still triggers the whole stored memory (pattern completion, needs recurrent/attractor dynamics) or only a
proportional piece of it (graded recall). The fly mushroom body is feedforward, so the prediction is graded
recall: a partial odour activates the subset of Kenyon cells its glomeruli drive, and the depressed synapses
are read only for those, so recall tracks the fraction of the cue present, with no sharp completion.
