"""Is the size of the memory a prediction, or only a calibration? Score the rule against Hige's own pulse arms.

Sections 1 to 3 set one number by hand: the learning rate, chosen so that ONE pairing block reproduces Hige et
al. 2015's ~90 % drop of the paired odour's drive at MBON-gamma1pedc. That is a calibration and the write-up
says so. But Hige's pairing block is not one event: it is FOUR 1 ms dopamine pulses at 2 Hz starting 0.2 s
after the onset of a 1 s odour. How those pulses combine is a property of the rule rather than of the fit, so
it can be scored. Three candidate rules all hit 0.90 at the four-pulse arm and disagree elsewhere:

  block is the unit   sections 1 to 3: one rule application per pairing block, no pulse axis at all, so one
                      pulse and four pulses give the same 0.90. Ratio 1.
  independent pulses  each pulse multiplies the synapse by the same factor: drop(p) = 1 - (1 - x)^p with
                      x = 1 - 0.1^(1/4) = 0.438. Pulse count matters, pulse TIMING does not. Ratio 0.49.
  eligibility trace   the rule in experiments/online.py: a pulse acts on the trace of recent Kenyon activity, which is
                      still charging early in the odour. Both count and timing matter.

Hige ran the discriminating experiment, though not quite the one that would separate them best. His single-
pulse arm gives 20 +/- 6.3 % depression of the UNPAIRED odour against 27 +/- 7.1 % for four pulses, a ratio of
0.74 +/- 0.30. That ratio is comparable to ours because under this rule a probe odour's drop is exactly (its
Kenyon-cell overlap with the trained odour) x (the paired drop), and the overlap cancels in a ratio.

The two arms differ in TWO ways, and both have to be reproduced: four pulses from +0.2 s versus one pulse at
+0.8 s. The delay is the point. By 0.8 s the eligibility trace has charged, so a trace rule expects one late
pulse to do nearly as much as four early ones, while a rule without timing expects it to do much less. Scoring
each arm at its own protocol is therefore not a detail; scoring the single pulse at +0.2 s instead (as an
earlier version of this module did) reverses which rule looks better.

What the measurement cannot do is choose: one ratio with that error bar leaves all three candidates standing.
The module reports the scores, says so, and states the experiment that WOULD separate them.
